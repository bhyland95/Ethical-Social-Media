# Ethical-Media

## Description

The very reasonable and ethical social media helps people rate other people so that a person can know what other people are thinking about them. A user can login, create a profile, be rated, and rate others. A user can rate anyone on any category. A user will first select a person to rate, create a category and then rate the person on that category.

We used Javascript, css, html, handlebars, node, api, and express to create this project
