# Ethical-Media

## Description

The very reasonable and ethical social media helps people rate other people so that a person can know what other people are thinking about them. A user can login, create a profile, be rated, and rate others. A user can rate anyone on any category. A user will first select a person to rate, create a category and then rate the person on that category.

We used Javascript, css, html, handlebars, node, api, and express to create this project

On start up, users are able to view other users profiles, the user's overall ratings, and click into the user's profile to see ratings left by others. However, if you would like to leave a rating of your own, you must login to the application and navigate to the user you would like to leave a rating for. Once here, you can leave a rating of 1-5 stars, with a category, and a short description.
